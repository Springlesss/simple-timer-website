# simple-timer-website

Just a simple timer website. It makes a sound when the timer is up. You can change the sound but it needs to have the exact same file name and extension (mp3).

You dont have to download anything as its plain javascript.
Feel free to use my code for your project!

FYI you dont have to credit me
